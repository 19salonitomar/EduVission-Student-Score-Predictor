# Student Score Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to predict student scores based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. It utilizes machine learning techniques and data analysis to gain insights into the factors affecting student performance.

## Features
- Predict student scores in math, reading, and writing.
- Analyze the impact of different factors on student performance.
- Modular coding structure for better organization and maintainability.
- Utilizes various libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Dill, and Flask.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:
- **Folders**: Different folders are used for modularizing code related to data processing, model training, exception handling, logging, frontend (HTML), and Flask.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust exception handling to ensure smooth execution and error reporting.
- **Logging**: Logging functionality implemented for tracking and debugging.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines set up for automated testing and deployment.
- **Prediction Pipelines**: Pipelines for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Frontend**: HTML coding for building a user-friendly interface to interact with the machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about students' demographic factors and their performance in math, reading, and writing exams.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Flask application to interact with the prediction model.
3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder for data analysis and model development.
4. Refer to the documentation and code comments for detailed explanations.
